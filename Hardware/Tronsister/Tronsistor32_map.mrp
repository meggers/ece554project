  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) removed
  17 block(s) optimized away
   8 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "PPU/bg_at/tbl/doutb<7>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "PPU/bg_at/tbl/doutb<6>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "PPU/bg_at/tbl/doutb<5>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "PPU/bg_at/tbl/doutb<4>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "PPU/bg_at/tbl/doutb<3>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "PPU/bg_at/tbl/doutb<2>" is sourceless and has been removed.

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "CPU/MEM_MemAddr<30>" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "CPU/MEMU/MemAddr_to_MemCtrl<30>1" (ROM) removed.
The signal "CPU/MEM_MemAddr<31>" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "CPU/MEMU/MemAddr_to_MemCtrl<31>1" (ROM) removed.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
